# Bright Future Commons

Bright Future Commons (BFCom) is being developed to serve as an intranet for [intentional networks](http://blog.kumu.io/building-intentional-networks-that-drive-impact-part-1/). [Context Institute](http://www.context.org/about/) is developing it as a platform to provide web support for the [Bright Future Network](https://www.context.org/bfnow/bright-future-network/) (BFNet).

It began as a fork of CUNYâ€™s [Commons In A Box](http://commonsinabox.org/), which is built on [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) and [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/), which are in turn built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). We have moved on to the [BuddyBoss Platform](https://www.buddyboss.com/platform/), also based on BuddyPress, bbPress and WordPress. We are continuing to use three plugins from Commons In A Box: BuddyPress Docs, BuddyPress Docs Wiki add-on and BuddyPress Group Email Subscription.

## Status

Our current focus is developing a child theme based on the BuddyBoss theme. If you like to learn more, please contact rgilman@context.org

## License

In keeping with the software it is built on, Bright Future Commons has a [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html) license.
